// calculate the percentage of overall scored marks

$percentage = ($totalMarks) / $totalSubjects * 100; // this is basically the equation to calculate percentage
echo "$percentage%"; // to get this percentage sign to echo out with the number you have to wrap the echo output in a string






// example 6
// You use the modulus operator to find the remainder of the operation


$a = 106 % 5; // this is basically when you divide 101 by 5, what is the remainder? It is 1
// echo $a

// check exponentiation

// ($a * $a) * ($b * $b)
