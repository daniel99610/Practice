// class is basically a big object that contains a lot of different information such as variables and functions regarding one thing

// we could have a class called user which has all of the information regarding the users such as the variables and the functions that might be related to the users
// when it comes to oop, we dont use the terms variables and functions anymore we say properties and methods, they are not entirely the same as variables and functions


class NewClass {

    // Properties and methods go here
    public $info =" This is some info";

    // how do we actually access stuff inside the class?


}

// instantiate a class
// this basically means we are creating some kind of object that contains all of the information regarding the class

// create a variable 

$object = new NewClass;
